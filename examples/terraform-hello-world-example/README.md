# Terraform Hello World Example

This folder contains the simplest possible Terraform module -- one that outputs "Hello, World!" -- to demonstrate how to use it to write automated tests.

This example is taken from here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/tree/master/examples/terraform-hello-world-example
