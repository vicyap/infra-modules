# Infrastructure Modules - Examples

This directory contains example modules that demonstrate how to use the infrastructure modules.

These examples also serve as tests for the modules. If an example fails to run, either the module is broken or the example needs to be updated.

See [tests](../tests) for how to run the tests.
